# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is amazing because of its versatility and widespread use in both front-end and back-end development. It powers interactive and dynamic web pages, enhances user experience, and with the advent of Node.js, it can also be used for server-side programming, making it a full-stack language.

## How to run a JavaScript script
You can run a JavaScript script using a JavaScript engine such as Node.js or by embedding it in an HTML document and executing it in a web browser.

## How to create variables and constants
Variables are created using the var, let, or const keywords followed by the variable name. Constants are created using the const keyword, and their values cannot be reassigned.

## Differences between var, const, and let
- var is function-scoped and can be redeclared within the same scope.
- let is block-scoped and can be reassigned within its scope.
- const is block-scoped but cannot be reassigned after initialization.

## All the data types available in JavaScript
- Primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol.
- Object data type: object.
- Special data type: bigint.

## How to use the if, if ... else statements
- if statements are used for conditional execution.
- if...else statements allow branching based on conditions.

## How to use comments
Comments in JavaScript are written using // for single-line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.

## How to assign values to variables
Values can be assigned to variables using the assignment operator =.

## How to use while and for loops
- while loops execute a block of code while a specified condition is true.
- for loops provide a compact way to iterate over a range of values.

## How to use break and continue statements
- break statement terminates the current loop.
- continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration.

## What is a function and how do you use functions
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions can be defined using the function keyword and called by their name followed by parentheses.

## What does a function that does not use any return statement return
A function that doesn't explicitly return anything returns undefined by default.

## Scope of variables
Scope defines the accessibility of variables. JavaScript has global scope, function scope, and block scope.

## Arithmetic operators and how to use them
Arithmetic operators include addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /, modulus %, increment ++, and decrement --.

## How to manipulate a dictionary
JavaScript doesn't have a built-in dictionary type, but you can use objects as dictionaries. Objects use key-value pairs to store data, and you can manipulate them using dot notation or bracket notation.

## How to import a file
- In Node.js, you can use the require() function to import modules/files.
- In client-side JavaScript, you can use script tags or module imports depending on the environment and setup.
