# README

## Overview

This README file provides an overview of the Python code provided. It explains the purpose of each class and function and how they interact with each other.

## Code Explanation

### `BaseModel` Class

- Represents the base model for all other classes in the project.
- Manages the instantiation of base objects and provides methods for serialization and deserialization to JSON and CSV formats.
- Includes a static method `draw_shapes` to visualize rectangles and squares using the Turtle module.

### `Rectangle` Class

- Represents a rectangle with attributes such as width, height, x coordinate, y coordinate, and identity.
- Inherits from the `BaseModel` class.
- Provides methods for calculating area, displaying the rectangle, updating attributes, and converting to a dictionary format.

### `Square` Class

- Represents a square, which is a special case of a rectangle with equal width and height.
- Inherits from the `Rectangle` class and overrides certain methods such as initialization and string representation.
- Provides methods for updating attributes and converting to a dictionary format.

## Usage

To use the provided Python code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download the Python files.
3. Run the desired Python file using the command `python3 filename.py`.
4. Follow the program's instructions or integrate it into your project as needed.

## Conclusion

The provided Python code offers a flexible and reusable framework for modeling rectangles and squares.
